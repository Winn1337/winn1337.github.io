        <p>
            I am a Bachelor’s graduate in Computer Science with a specialization in Game Development from Malmö University. 
            My primary focus is C++ and real-time systems, with strong experience in system architecture, multithreading, 
            concurrency, and graphics programming through both academic and personal projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            My technical foundation includes C/C++, C#, Python, and SQL, with additional familiarity in JavaScript, 
            HTML/CSS, and GDScript. I have worked with tools and frameworks such as Git, Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot, 
            and I am particularly interested in low-level systems, performance-critical applications, and scalable software design.
        </p>

        <p>
            For my bachelor’s thesis, I was part of developing TopDogEngine, a single-file 3D game prototyping framework written in C++ 
            using Vulkan. The project emphasized user-friendliness, performance, and extensibility, reflecting my interest 
            in clean architecture and efficient real-time rendering systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alongside my technical background, I have professional experience in production and customer-facing roles. 
            At Axis Communications in Lund, I worked in production assembling and testing security and communication devices 
            while adhering to strict quality and process standards. Previously, at Transcom, I managed customer cases from 
            first contact to resolution, working across multiple systems under time pressure while maintaining high quality standards.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am fluent in Swedish and English and currently seeking 
            software engineering roles within systems engineering, embedded software, or game development where I can 
            contribute to robust, high-performance, fun, or otherwise meaningful software solutions.
        </p>
