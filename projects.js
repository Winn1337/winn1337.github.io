        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
        Swing and a Miss was my submission to Game Lab Jam: VT 25 and it turned out to be the overall winner of the jam!
        It was developed in 48 hours, but I spent some time polishing it after the jam ended. It's still a work in progress,
        but I am very proud of the result and I'm planning on working it into a state where it can be released on Steam.
        </p>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p> You can play the latest version of the game on itch.io. </p>
